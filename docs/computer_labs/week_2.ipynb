    "In this tutorial you will become familiar with `Python`, and `Jupyter Notebooks` (.ipynb).  You will get to know the two main cell types in Jupyter Notebooks and the keyboard shortcuts that allow you to manipulate them easily.  We will then do some basic exploratory econometric analysis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Important note\n",
    "You need to have the datasets available before you run any commands. If you haven't already, please refer to the [instructions](https://juergenmeinecke.github.io/EMET2007/jupyter.html) on the course website for setting this up.\n",

    "The source data for this week's tutorial comes from the World Bank which keeps a database called *World Development Indicators*. The WDI database is updated each year in April and collects about 800 different economic variables for more than 150 countries. For example, the World Bank collects basic macroeconomic data on GDP and growth rates, as well as data such as land areas, population size and also data on the environment, corruption, political institutions, poverty and many more.\n",

    "Note: To make it slightly easier for us syntactically, I have changed the variable names to use `camelCase`.\n",

    "| ``population`` |          Total number of residents (regardless of legal status or citizenship) |\n",

That's what we're doing in the cell below. `pandas` is a package that is widely used for data analysis, and `pandas` plays nicely with many other `Python` packages used for scientific computing.  For more information on `pandas`, see [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/). \n",
